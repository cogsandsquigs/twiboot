# Twiboot

Twiboot is a Particle library that allows for interfacing with the Twiboot bootloader.
It is a simple library that allows for the flashing of a new firmware to a Twiboot-enabled device.

## Installation:

Make sure that your MCU of choice has [twiboot](https://github.com/orempel/twiboot) installed. A makefile
is included here, however, this is mainly for my own purposes (for custom-building twiboot) and is not
recommended for use.
